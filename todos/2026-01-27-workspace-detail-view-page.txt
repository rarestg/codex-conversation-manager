Title: Workspace detail view + “Open workspace” entry point

Why
- Workspaces are a primary way users mentally organize sessions, but the UI only offers a filtered home list.
- A workspace-forward view would make it easier to browse, slice, and search within a single repo.

Scope / intent
- Add an “Open workspace” button/link alongside “Open on GitHub” in the Workspaces panel.
- New workspace detail page that focuses on a single workspace: grid/list of conversations, optimized for scanning.
- Provide filters and sorting within the workspace view (branch, date, rounds/turns, etc.).
- Include a dedicated search that scopes to this workspace only.
- Use the available viewport space to show richer session cards (grid layout or dense list with metadata chips).

Notes
- Consider URL structure (e.g., `?workspace=...` or `/workspaces/:slug`) and deep-linking.
- Ensure scoping does not require reindexing; reuse existing session metadata.
- Decide how this interacts with global search + home filters.
