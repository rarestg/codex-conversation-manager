Pill text centering (Session cards) — what worked

Context
- Small 10px pill text in the Sessions list looked vertically low vs the pill’s centerline.
- Icons were centered, text wasn’t, creating a visual mismatch.

What we tried (did NOT fix it)
1) line-height tweaks only
   - text-[10px]/[12px]
   - leading-none
   Result: no visible change in text position.

2) fixed-height pills
   - h-5, items-center, removed py-* and used text-[10px]/[1]
   Result: pill got taller but text still looked low.

3) tiny optical nudge with positional offset
   - relative -top-[0.5px]
   Result: no visible change.

4) stronger optical nudge (transform)
   - translate-y-[-1px]
   Result: moved text upward (worked), but overshot for this pill.

5) larger downward nudges
   - translate-y-[2px]
   - translate-y-[1.5px]
   - translate-y-[1px]
   Result: still visually low.

What worked
- translate-y-[0.5px] on the text span itself (not the icon).
- This gave the most balanced optical centering in the pill.

Why this happens
- The issue is font metrics / baseline (Sora at 10px) — the glyph sits low inside its line box.
- Flexbox centers the line box, not the glyph. So padding/height/leading don’t fix the optical alignment.

Current solution
- Apply the offset to the text-only spans in the time / duration / turns pills:
  - className="translate-y-[0.5px]"

Notes for future
- If the font or size changes, re-evaluate the offset.
- A reusable “pill-text-optical” class could centralize the offset.
