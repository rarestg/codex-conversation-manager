Handoff: Sessions UI / UX Improvements

Overview
We’ve been iterating on the Sessions panel (right-side list) to make it easier to scan: readable date labels, session metadata pills, and cleaner rows (no filename). We also switched to overlay scrollbars and started using Lucide icons.

Key files
- src/features/conversation/components/SessionsPanel.tsx
  - Main Sessions list UI (year/month/day accordion + session cards)
  - Where most visual tweaks were made
- src/features/conversation/format.ts
  - Date label helpers (formatMonthLabel, formatDayLabel)
  - Duration / relative time helpers
- server/apiPlugin.ts
  - Session indexing: now includes session ID, turns, timestamps, etc.
- src/index.css
  - OverlayScrollbars theme (.os-theme-codex)
- src/main.tsx
  - Imports OverlayScrollbars CSS

What changed (high level)
- Date labels:
  - Month: “01 January”
  - Day: “21 Wednesday”
- Sessions list items:
  - Title uses first user message (fallback “Session”)
  - Filename removed from UI
  - Metadata pills: time (Clock), duration (Hourglass), turns (Repeat2), repo (GitHub), branch (GitBranch)
- Session ID is now a pill with Fingerprint icon; clicking copies it
- Session IDs are sourced from session_meta.payload.id (fixed in parser/indexer)
- Overlay scrollbars enabled for Sessions list via overlayscrollbars-react
- Lucide icons added (also used in header Home + Settings)

Important behaviors
- Session IDs now guaranteed in data:
  - server/apiPlugin.ts pulls payload.id and falls back to filename
- Session row click opens session
- Session ID pill is a separate button to copy ID

Text centering (pills)
- Pill text looked low due to font metrics (Sora at 10px).
- Working fix: optical nudge on the text span itself:
  - translate-y-[0.5px]
- Full experiment history documented in:
  - todos/_learnings/pill-text-centering.txt

If you tweak pills
- Use the same base pill styling for consistency:
  - inline-flex items-center gap-1 rounded-full bg-white px-2 py-0.5 text-[10px]/[12px] text-slate-600 shadow-sm
- Keep the text-nudge span for optical centering:
  - <span className="translate-y-[0.5px]">…</span>

How to run
- npm run typecheck
- npm run format:write

Notes for future improvements
- Potential improvements still open:
  - Centralize pill styles into reusable class/component
  - Add copy icon to other copy buttons
  - Extend overlay scrollbars to search results/workspaces if desired
