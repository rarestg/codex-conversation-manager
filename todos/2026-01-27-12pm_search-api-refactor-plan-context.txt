Status as of 2026-01-27:

Implemented (plan steps 1–9 complete; checks run after each):
- Server API refactor: new routing layer + utilities (server/routes/index.ts, server/http.ts) and slimmer server/apiPlugin.ts.
- Config/path safety extracted to server/config.ts.
- DB + logging extracted to server/db/index.ts and server/logging.ts.
- Indexing + session-tree builders extracted to server/indexing/index.ts and server/indexing/tree.ts.
- Search normalization + queries extracted to server/search/normalize.ts and server/search/queries.ts.
- Workspace helpers extracted and search updated to use Option A summaries (server/workspaces.ts).
- Search performance: workspace filter applied in matches CTE, workspace summaries limited to result workspaces, early empty guard.
- Server-Timing headers + requestId echo for /api/search and /api/session-matches.
- Shared API types added in shared/apiTypes.ts and wired through client + server (tsconfig includes updated).

Not implemented yet (plan steps 10–11 remainder):
- Tests (explicitly deferred).
