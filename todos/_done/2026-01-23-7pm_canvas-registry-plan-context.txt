Canvas Registry + Variant Playground Context

Goals
- Introduce a manual canvas registry under src/features/conversation/canvas/ for demo/variant definitions.
- Refactor CanvasView to consume the registry, scale to 4+ variants, and keep per-variant toggle state.
- Allow future demos that don’t use SessionOverview or session data without refactoring the registry API.
- Add styling slots to SessionHeader + SessionOverview without changing production behavior.
- Keep /layouts as an alias of /canvas.

Key decisions and guidance
- Registry location: src/features/conversation/canvas/registry.tsx.
- Avoid hooks in registry entries; registry should point at components that own their hooks.
- Preserve per-variant state with a wrapper component that calls useSessionOverview and uses key={variant.id}.
- Variant selection should be a Set/array of variant IDs derived from activeDemo.variants (no 'both' | 'a' | 'b').
- Store selection per demo (Record<demoId, string[]>), so switching demos restores prior selections.
- For demos that do not require session data, hide the session picker and render with null/empty data.
- Initial variants should render identical layouts; actual visual differences will be added later.

Canvas registry/data model
- Define a CanvasContext (session data optional) in src/features/conversation/canvas/types.ts.
- CanvasDemoVariant exposes a Component that receives { context }.
- SessionHeader demo variants live in a separate file (sessionHeaderVariants.tsx) and call useSessionOverview internally.

Styling slots to add (semantic, shallow)
- SessionOverview: containerClassName, toggleGridClassName.
- SessionHeader: headerClassName, titleClassName, metaGridClassName, statsRowClassName, actionsClassName.
- Keep defaults identical; only apply optional overrides when provided.

CanvasView behavior
- Demo selector lists canvasDemos entries and shows demo description.
- Variant selector is dynamic from activeDemo.variants and supports multi-select.
- Session picker only appears when activeDemo.requiresSessionData is true.
- Render variants by mapping selected variants and invoking their Component with context.

Implementation checklist
- Create src/features/conversation/canvas/registry.tsx with CanvasDemo type and canvasDemos array.
- Add a SessionHeader demo entry with 2 variants (A/B).
- Add src/features/conversation/canvas/types.ts to define CanvasContext.
- Add src/features/conversation/canvas/sessionHeaderVariants.tsx to host hook-using variants.
- Refactor CanvasView to select a demo from canvasDemos and render its description.
- Replace hard-coded A/B toggle UI with dynamic variant selection based on activeDemo.variants.
- Replace hard-coded A/B rendering with mapping over selected variants and calling their Component.
- Keep per-variant state by wrapping each variant in its own component that calls useSessionOverview.
- Hide the session picker when activeDemo.requiresSessionData is false.
- Add styling hooks to SessionHeader + SessionOverview (see slots above).
- Ensure no changes to ConversationMain/production session view behavior.

Verification
- npm run typecheck
- npm run check
- Manual: /canvas (and /layouts) demo selector/variant toggles; normal session view unchanged.
