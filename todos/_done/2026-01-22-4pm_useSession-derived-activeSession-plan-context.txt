Active Session Derived State (Context + Execution Summary)

Overview
We implemented the derived activeSession refactor in useSession to remove the update loop caused by syncing activeSession state in an effect. The hook now stores only minimal state (activeSessionId + parsedMeta) and computes the activeSession view model via useMemo, merging indexed data when available with parsed metadata as fallback. This removes the self‑triggering state update and stabilizes rendering.

What Was Implemented
1) Minimal session state in useSession
- Added ParsedMeta type with preview/startedAt/endedAt/turnCount/filename.
- Replaced activeSession state with activeSessionId + parsedMeta.
- clearSession now resets activeSessionId + parsedMeta.

2) Derived activeSession via useMemo
- activeSession is computed from:
  - indexed session entry (from sessionsTree) when available
  - parsedMeta for fallback preview/timestamps/turn counts
  - a stable fallback SessionFileEntry for required fields
- Merge precedence prefers indexed metadata and preserves parsedMeta when indexed fields are missing.
- sessionId fallback uses extractSessionIdFromPath(activeSessionId), otherwise ''.

3) Removed syncing effect
- The effect that previously updated activeSession based on sessionsTree is gone.
- The only remaining effect in useSession handles scroll-to-turn behavior.

Files Touched (Core)
- src/features/conversation/hooks/useSession.ts

Notes / Alignment
- The derived activeSession updates automatically when sessionsTree loads or changes (reindex/workspace filter) without setState loops.
- Parsed meta is computed once in loadSession via buildDerivedMeta, as intended.

Verification (Observed)
- activeSession is returned from useMemo with stable dependencies (activeSessionId, parsedMeta, findSessionById).
- No activeSession syncing effect remains in useSession.

End State
- The update loop is removed and the activeSession model is derived deterministically, reducing re-render churn and improving UI responsiveness.
