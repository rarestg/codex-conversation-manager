Context: Script-aware minimum token length for search

Summary
Implemented a soft minimum token-length rule for search that blocks noisy single-letter Latin queries while preserving short non‑Latin and numeric searches. The server now short-circuits too-short queries, the client mirrors the same logic (including token cap), and the UI shows a clear “Type at least 3 characters to search” hint instead of “No matches.”

Key changes
- Added script-aware searchable-token rules in server normalizeFtsQuery: Latin >= 3, numeric >= 2, non‑Latin >= 1.
- Mirrored the same rules and token cap in useSearch so client/server behavior stays aligned.
- Introduced a derived `searchTooShort` flag and a dedicated UI hint in SearchPanel; forwarded through ConversationViewer and Sidebar.
- Preserved the soft-min behavior: short tokens are still included when there is at least one searchable token.

Files touched
- server/apiPlugin.ts
- src/features/conversation/hooks/useSearch.ts
- src/features/conversation/components/SearchPanel.tsx
- src/features/conversation/components/Sidebar.tsx
- src/features/conversation/ConversationViewer.tsx

Notes
- Latin min length remains 3 (per decision), so “AI”/“Go” are intentionally blocked unless paired with a longer token.
- UUID searches remain unaffected because they go through the resolve path, not FTS.
- Ran npm run typecheck and npm run check (required a biome formatting pass).
