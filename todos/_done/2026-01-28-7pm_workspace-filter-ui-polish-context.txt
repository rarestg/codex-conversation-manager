Title: Workspace filter clarity + sessions/search header alignment (Completion)

Summary
- Applied consistent workspace filter messaging across Search/Sessions (with sidebar hiding to reduce clutter) and kept filters as a global state.
- Reworked Sessions header spacing/alignment so Refresh no longer visually aligns with filter pills on wrap.
- Fixed workspace card clickability while keeping GitHub link separate and valid HTML.
- Tightened Search header layout for responsive wrap spacing using a grid-based header row.

What Changed
- SearchPanel and SessionsPanel show consistent workspace filter pills; sidebar versions hide the filter UI for space.
- Workspace selection clears when entering a session to avoid cramped sidebar state.
- Sessions header layout adjusted to keep refresh alignment and spacing consistent when pills wrap.
- Workspace cards restructured so the whole card is clickable while keeping the GitHub link as a distinct target.
- Added non-GitHub folder icons where appropriate for visual consistency.
- Search header now uses grid layout + explicit wrap breakpoint to preserve gap rhythm on narrow widths.

Notes
- Filter copy is “Workspace filter on/off” rather than “Filtered by workspace,” but the UI now communicates global filter state consistently.
- Link behavior improvements (session list/search results as real links) landed alongside this work for native browser navigation.
