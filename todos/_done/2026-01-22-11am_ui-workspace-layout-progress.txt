Workspaces + Sessions layout adjustments (progress notes)

What changed
- Home layout now places Workspaces on the left and Sessions on the right, with a 50/50 split (repo-first flow).
- Session mode sidebar moved to the right (lg:flex-row-reverse) to keep layout consistent between home and session views.
- Workspace cards: right column (sessions/date/time) stays top-right by using a non-wrapping layout on larger screens.
- Timestamp display: date and time are split into separate lines; time is displayed without seconds.
- Paths shorten home directories to ~ for readability and less wrapping pressure.
- GitHub URL is replaced with an “Open on GitHub” link when a GitHub slug is available; otherwise the raw git URL is shown.

Why
- The repo-first workflow is more natural: pick a workspace first, then scan sessions and search.
- A consistent layout (right sidebar) reduces spatial shifts between home and session modes.
- Long paths were pushing the session/date info below; shortening paths and constraining layout keeps metadata aligned.
- Removing seconds and splitting the date/time gives the left column more breathing room.
- The GitHub link is cleaner than a long git URL and easier to act on.
